# Sequencer-Client  (WIP ðŸš§)
Pure Rust implementation of Arbitrum sequencer feed reader with built-in transaction decoding and MEV features

## Design Goal
This Rust implementation is designed for a high number of concurrent connections and faster performance than the original Go implementation, with MEV-specific features.

## Quick Start
To use this sequencer-client, you'll need Tokio as your main runtime.

Here is a basic example.
```Rust
use crossbeam_channel::unbounded;
use sequencer_client::feed_clients::RelayClients;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Create a channel to receive messages from the feed client
    let (sender, receiver) = unbounded();

    // Create a new relay client and start reader + connection maintainer
    let relay_client = RelayClients::new("wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed", 42161, 2, 1, sender)
        .expect("Failed to create relay client");
    tokio::spawn(RelayClients::start_reader(relay_client));

    // To prevent duplicate messages
    let mut highest_seq_number: i64 = 0;

    loop {
        let data = receiver
            .recv()
            .expect("Failed to receive data from feed client");

        let msg_seq_num = data.messages[0].sequence_number;


        if highest_seq_number >= msg_seq_num {
            continue;
        }

        highest_seq_number = msg_seq_num;

        info!("Received message, sequencer_number: {:?} ", msg_seq_num);
    }
}

```

## Status
Currently, the sequencer-reader does not have full transaction decoding and only includes the MEV specific parts
